# Product Overview

TestersPlaybook is a lightweight, production-intended SaaS for indie developers and small teams who need manual test management, task tracking, and clear execution workflows without the overhead of enterprise tools.

It is not a Jira replacement or a full Agile suite. It is a practical workspace for test design and execution before teams outgrow spreadsheets.

## Core Capabilities
- Projects with roles (Owner, Contributor)
- Modules for organizing features
- Manual test cases with structured steps and expected results
- Test runs with controlled lifecycle and locking after completion
- Execution tracking per test case (UNTESTED, PASSED, FAILED, BLOCKED) with notes
- Bugs linked to test cases and test runs
- Tasks as generic work items with status, assignment, due dates, and comments
- Product Specs (rich-text) for describing the product and flows
- UI References (image-based) to keep testing aligned with designs
- AI assistance for test case generation, improvement, and module analysis

## Who It Is For
- Indie developers and solo founders
- Small product teams without dedicated QA infrastructure
- Contributors who need clear assignments and lightweight collaboration

## What It Is Not
- An enterprise ALM tool
- A Scrum or sprint management system
- An automation execution platform
- A CI/CD integration hub
